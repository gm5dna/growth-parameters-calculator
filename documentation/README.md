## Documentation Structure

### Core Documents

- **`/PROJECT.md`** (root) - **START HERE** - Complete project reference
  - Tech stack, file structure, design decisions
  - Feature status, backlog, deployment guide
  - Single source of truth for all project context

- **`/CLAUDE.md`** (root) - AI assistance quick reference
  - Streamlined for token efficiency
  - Points to PROJECT.md for details

## Quick Navigation

**For Claude/AI:**
1. Read `/PROJECT.md` first (comprehensive context)
2. Reference `/CLAUDE.md` for quick lookup
3. Dive into `TECHNICAL.md` or `PROJECT_DESIGN.md` as needed

**For Developers:**
1. Start with `/PROJECT.md` (overview, features, backlog, deployment)
2. Read `TECHNICAL.md` (architecture)
3. Review `PROJECT_DESIGN.md` (design decisions)
4. Check `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` (codebase organization)

**For Users:**
1. Visit https://gm5dna.github.io/growth-parameters-calculator/
2. Or read `USER_GUIDE.md` in this folder

## Documentation Principles

- **PROJECT.md is the source of truth** - All other docs reference it
- **CLAUDE.md is token-optimized** - Only essentials for AI
- **Technical docs are detailed** - For deep dives when needed
- **Keep updated** - Update PROJECT.md with each major change
